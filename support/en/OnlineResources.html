Check the SQL Anywhere web site for maintenance releases and the latest bug fixes.
<P><B>The information below may be subject to periodic updates. Please <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/sqlanywhere">visit us online</a> for the most current information on SQL Anywhere licensing, features, and services.</B>
<h4>SQL Anywhere Products and Licensing</h4>
SQL Anywhere is available in a number of base packages with additional deployment licenses and separately licensed components. To start, select the base package that best fits your requirements. Base packages are available in two licensing models: (a) Servers and Seats; and (b) Processor-based.
<P>

The Servers and Seats model include a SQL Anywhere Network Server and a stated number of user licenses. Each of these users is licensed as a Network Seat to provide client access to the SQL Anywhere Server. Each of these users is also licensed for the SQL Anywhere Personal Server with Synchronization and Ultralite with Synchronization.
<P>

Alternatively, customers can choose the SQL Anywhere Server CPU License. This package licenses the SQL Anywhere Network Server on one machine for the number of CPU licenses purchased. There is no limit on the number of users that can connect as Networked Seats to the Server, making this package ideal for larger client/server and Web-based deployments or where customers prefer processor-based licensing rather than counting users or seats.
<P>

SQL Anywhere base packages also include licensing for a number of design and management tools including Sybase Central and PowerDesigner Physical Data Model.
<P>
<h4>Deployment Licenses</h4>
Need to license more users or additional components? No problem. Licenses are available for additional Network Seats (clients), Network Servers, Personal Servers, Synchronization, and Ultralite.
